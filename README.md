Partial Geometry
===
Creativity in naming, amirite?

I had this model file where things were divided up correctly, but I needed a method of determining, visually,
where the model should be broken apart. Simply 'hiding' wouldn't suffice, because I'd need to write the changes to
disk. I'm publishing the important code here for others to use and improve.

My complete implementation has a bit of UI for selecting the desired range, and code to serialize the selected
geometry. The UI is rough and very temporary. If I ever come up with something I feel is Worthy, I'll publish it also.
